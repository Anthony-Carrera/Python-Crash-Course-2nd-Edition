"""
9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and
last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user
profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s
information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized
greeting to the user.
Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each
user.
